	<h3>Introducing PixelText! A review and blog aggregation site tailored to gamers and writers.</h3>

	<p>PixelText is a website that aims to serve as a space to post video game reviews and blog posts. As such, by the time of the final release, user accounts will be able to compose essay-length posts from the website, view the work of others, and search for games to review.</p>
	<p>Secondary goals of our website include designing a user interface that is reminiscent of older websites, but familiar to users of any skill level. Additionally, we researched and used best practices for keeping sensitive information inaccessible and secure, and we have kept a consistent distinction between client-side and server-side code and functions.</p>
	<p>This project has afforded us (the INDY-11 dev team) valuable experience in working with tools we have not used previously. HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL were either only previously used once in passing or entirely new territory for us. Even more valuable are the more abstract skills gained from the project - those such as connecting a frontend to a backend and becoming comfortable with a Linux terminal. However, the most valuable skill we have gained is the ability to self-manage a large undertaking such as building a website that is truly from the ground up.</p>
